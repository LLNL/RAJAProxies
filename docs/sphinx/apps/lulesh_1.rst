LULESH v1.0
===========

Computer simulations of a wide variety of science and engineering problems
require modeling hydrodynamics-which describe the motion of materials
relative to each other when subject to forces. Many important simulation
problems of interest to DOE involve complex multi-material systems that undergo
large deformations. LULESH is a highly simplified application, hard-coded to
only solve a simple Sedov blast problem with analytic answers. However, it represents
the numerical algorithms, data motion, and programming style typical in
scientific C or C++ based applications.
