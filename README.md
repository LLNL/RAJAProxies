# RAJA Proxy Applications

This project contains a collections of proxy applications written using the 
[RAJA Rerformance Portability Layer](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA). 
These applications are examples of how RAJA is used in real codes and 
provideng a convenient vehicle for testing features and analyzing performance.

## Quick Start

This repository is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAProxies).
To clone the repo into your local working space, use the command:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAProxies.git 

The `--recursive` argument is used to download the repository's submodules, 
RAJA and the build system [BLT](https://github.com/LLNL/blt). After you 
execute this command, you will see the `master` branch in the `raja-proxies` 
directory. 

Then, you can build RAJA and the proxy applications like any other CMake 
project, provided you have a C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard. 
The simplest way to build the code is to do the following in the top-level 
`raja-proxies` directory (in-source builds are not allowed!):

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../
    $ make

More details about RAJA configuration options are located in the 
[**RAJA User Guide and Tutorial**](http://raja.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

The executable for Each application will be located in the `bin` directory
of your build space.  The CoMD executables are the only exception to this
rule in that they will be located in bin/CoMD/src-[version]/bin where
[version] is the src you built CoMD from.  This version has to do with the
programming model used. The executable names will include the name of the proxy
app, its version and parallel programming model it is using. To run an
application, simply run the desired executable. For example, to run 
run the RAJA version of LULESH v1.0 with the OpenMP backend, execute the
following command:

    $ ./lulesh-v1.0-RAJA-omp.exe
